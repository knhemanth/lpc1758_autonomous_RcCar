To get started, have a look at lpc_freerots_xxxx/L5_Application/main.cpp and the example tasks.

The general idea is to interact with the project through terminal commands.

See "ChangeLog" for the changes made to the sample project source code.

Because it is a different platform, the source has been placed in its own directory.
