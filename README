This is Sensor controller node's code. This node basically send all distance sensor's zone data over CAN bus to Master Controller to figure out Obstacle avoidance algorithm.
Here we have used Ultrasonic sensors(from parallax) as a distance sensor.
To get started, have a look at lpc_freerots_RcCar/L5_Application/main.cpp and the specific periodic_scheduler task.

Look into lpc_freerots_RcCar/L5_Application/periodic_scheduler/period_callbacks.cpp file to figure out how all functions are working for 
Sensor_controller as we have defined all different tasks in periodic functions itself.

period_init() and period_reg_tlm() functions are calling only once before operating system starts and then period_1Hz(),
period_10Hz(),period_100Hz(),period_1000Hz() functions will be called in that much repetative fixed interval.

Make sure that priority of high frequency function is higher then low frequency functions.

Means if we prioritize those periodic functions in higher order to lower order, then that will be as below.
1000Hz > 100Hz > 10Hz > 1Hz
