things to consider-

- using the clickListener method that comes with the Maps API.

"Added README.md"
- Created a README as a means to set an agendas and detail changes and implementations made to the app.		

"Used OnMapClick"
- Used the OnMapClick event that is part of the maps API as opposed to a ClickListener event that's connected to a button
- Marker now appears at the center of the screen as opposed to a preset location on screen. Solves the problem of having to move around to find a pointer
- Added a Route Button.

"Added a JSONParser Class"
- Added a JSON Parser to parse a string.


things to consider-
- Routes API to be implemented between a source and destination marker.
- Duplication issue with marker needs to be looked at.
